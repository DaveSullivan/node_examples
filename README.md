# Website built using Node.js and Express.js
website adapted from the Lynda lesson on building websites with Node and express to include a few pictures from my trip to Jamaica

The live running site can be found here:
https://davesullivanla-negril.herokuapp.com/
This is a free hosted site so the large pictures load very slow.
Also, this site works better in Chrome than IE
